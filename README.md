FizzBuzz Solution in PHP
    This repository contains a PHP implementation of the classic FizzBuzz problem, enhanced with command line argument parsing and validation. 
    The FizzBuzz problem is a common programming task, often used in coding interviews, that involves printing numbers from 1 to N with the following rules:

    * For multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
    * For multiples of five, print "Buzz" instead of the number.
    * For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz".
    * For all other numbers, simply print the number.

Solution Overview
    The solution provided in this repository is a PHP script that demonstrates the FizzBuzz problem, utilizing a class-based approach and command line arguments for input. 
    It includes a FizzBuzz class with a method start() that takes no arguments. The method reads the value of N from the command line.
    It validates that the second argument is indeed the name of the correct function "start" and that the third argument is a positive integer N.
    It then applies the FizzBuzz logic to each number from 1 through N.

Key Features:
    Object-Oriented Approach: The solution encapsulates the FizzBuzz logic within a FizzBuzz class, promoting modularity and reusability.
    Command Line Arguments and Validation: The script reads the value of N from the command line, allowing for dynamic input. 
    It validates that the second argument is indeed the name of the correct function "start" and the third argument is a positive integer N, ensuring the correct usage of the script.
    Scalability: The algorithm's time complexity is O(N), which is optimal for this problem. It scales linearly with the input size.
    Ease of Use: The code is simple and can be easily modified or extended for different requirements.

Implementation Details
    The FizzBuzz class contains a start() method that iterates through numbers from 1 to N using a for loop. 
    For each number, it checks if the number is divisible by 3, 5, or both, and outputs the corresponding string. 
    The method validates the command line arguments to ensure they meet the expected criteria.

Example Usage
    To run the script, use the following command in the terminal:
    php fizzbuzz.php start 4
    This command will execute the FizzBuzz logic for numbers from 1 to 4, after validating the input.

Testing
    To test the script, you can change the value of N in the command line. For example, using php fizzbuzz.php start 20 will test the function with numbers up to 20.
